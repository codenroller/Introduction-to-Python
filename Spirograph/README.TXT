Code for the main course project: Spirograph

Main project code: Spiro/spiro.py
  It contains a code taken from Mahesh Venkitachalam book "Python Playground".
  Please check and try the trinket here: https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/cafd6970fb
  
  
There are two additional code examples:
Circle/circle.py: It contains a code that draws a circle using parametric equations
SimpleSpiro/simplespiro.py: It contains the code of drawing a plain spiro (with no fancy add-ons included)
  Please check and try trinket here: https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/076a815583
I expect that two above mentioned examples make it easier to understand the main project and source code.
